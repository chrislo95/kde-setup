sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip
sudo apt install clangd-13 //for kate and visit clangd website, had to restart afterwards
sudo apt install git curl wget nmap
sudo apt install zsh //then go to oh my zsh github page to finish install
sudo apt install ssh

//steps to get LSP python to work
pip3 install python-lsp-server

then have to add it to $PATH in order for it to work.
Go to ~/.zshrc and add this : export PATH="$HOME/techpc/.local/bin:$PATH"
then use this : source ~/.zshrc
then use this to check if it was added correctly : echo $PATH

CORRECTION : export PATH="$HOME/techpc/.local/bin:$PATH" does not work correctly. It needs to be export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
Then for kate to work you need to change the config file to point to the correct file.
Example:
"python": {
            "command": ["/home/techpc/.local/bin/pylsp", "--check-parent-process"],
            "url": "https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server",
            "highlightingModeRegex": "^Python$"
